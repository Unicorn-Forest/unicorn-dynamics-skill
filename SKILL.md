# Unicorn Dynamics

Strategic visual planning and operational intelligence framework integrating Grove Consulting methodologies, Christopher Alexander's differentiation processes, and self-ontogenetic cognitive architectures.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Knowledge Sharing Mechanism (KSM)

The KSM combines Alexander's differentiation process with PDCA cycles for iterative problem-solving.

**Alexander's 11-Step Differentiation Process:**
1. Observe partially evolved state (wholeness as system of centres)
2. Attend to wholeness - global order, actual and latent
3. Identify where structure is weakest as a whole
4. Look for latent centres dimly present
5. Choose one latent centre to strengthen
6. Apply structure-preserving transformations
7. New centres are born, strengthening the whole
8. Increase strength of larger, parallel, and smaller centres
9. Test that life has actually increased
10. Test that differentiation is simplest possible
11. Return to beginning, repeat cycle

**Four Conditions for Differentiation:**
- Awareness of the Whole
- Step-by-Step Adaptation
- Unpredictability
- Feedback

### 2. KIM Roles (PDCA Mapping)

| Role | PDCA | Function | Mode |
|------|------|----------|------|
| **Framer** | Plan | Design architecture, see problem as whole | Topsight |
| **Maker** | Do | Create innovative solutions (Hoshin) | Insight |
| **Finder** | Act | Find resources, refine products (Kaizen) | Insight |
| **Sharer** | Check | Provide feedback, disseminate knowledge | Topsight |

### 3. T-System (9 Transformations)

Map cognitive/operational phases to four centres (C1-Idea, C2-Knowledge, C3-Routine, C4-Form):

| T-Code | Name | Description | Dimension |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------|
| T1 | Perception | Pairs coalesce, need relates to capacity | M/Performance |
| T2 | Creation | Form fed back through routine to idea | G/Potential |
| T3 | Transference | Idea transferred to form via knowledge+routine | G/Universal |
| T4 | Mental Work | Sensory/proprioceptive alternation | C/Commitment |
| T5 | Physical Work | Idea→Knowledge→Routine with feedback | C/Commitment |
| T6 | Corporeal Body | Mutual identities within common form | C/Universal |
| T7 | Memory Resources | Routine+Form quantized as technique | G/Potential |
| T8 | Creative Feedback | Countercurrent balances form with idea | M/Performance |
| T9 | Renewed Perception | Discretionary hierarchy: C1→C2→C3→C4 | M/Universal |

### 4. M/G/C Dimensions

| Code | Dimension | Focus | Architecture |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **M** | Performance | Execution, output, response | b9 (localhost terminal) |
| **G** | Potential | Ideas, resources, memory | p9 (globalhost membranes) |
| **C** | Commitment | Work, feedback, integration | j9 (orgalhost topology) |

## Grove Graphic Guides

### Planning Cycles

**Current Environment (Steps 1-4):**
- Context Map → Investment Portfolio → Graphic History → Industry Structure

**Future Planning (Steps 5-8):**
- Cover Story Vision → Mandala Vision → Journey Vision → Stakeholder Map

**Action Planning (Steps 9-12):**
- Five Bold Steps → Value Proposition → Graphic Gameplan → Graphic Roadmap

### Guide Selection Matrix

| Guide | Type | Dimension | When to Use |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Context Map | Structure | Performance | Environmental scanning, trend identification |
| SPOT Matrix | Process | Commitment | Strengths/Problems/Opportunities/Threats |
| Cover Story Vision | Process | Commitment | Future-state visioning from magazine format |
| Five Bold Steps | Process | Commitment | Specific strategies toward vision |
| Graphic Gameplan | Process | Commitment | Whole-systems action planning |
| Graphic Roadmap | Process | Commitment | Milestone tracking, deliverables |
| Journey Vision | Process | Potential | Past/present/future visualization |
| Mandala Vision | Structure | Potential | Vision themes as unified whole |
| Stakeholder Map | Structure | Potential | Network of connected parties |
| Value Proposition | Structure | Potential | Products, connections, infrastructure |
| Investment Portfolio | Structure | Potential | Sow/Grow/Plow/Harvest lifecycle |
| Industry Structure Map | Structure | Commitment | Value chain analysis |
| Graphic History | Structure | Performance | Organizational evolution |

## Workflow: Strategic Visioning Session

### Phase 1: Current Environment Analysis
1. **Meeting Startup** (River Rafting or Treasure Map) - Establish OARRs
2. **Context Map** - Scan external environment, identify trends
3. **Graphic History** - Harvest lessons from organizational evolution
4. **SPOT Matrix** - Assess current position

### Phase 2: Future Planning
5. **Cover Story Vision** - Create intuitive future-state story
6. **Mandala Vision** - Cluster themes into unified whole
7. **Journey Vision** - Map past→present→future trajectory
8. **Stakeholder Map** - Identify key relationships

### Phase 3: Action Planning
9. **Five Bold Steps** - Define specific strategic initiatives
10. **Value Proposition** - Clarify offer, connection, infrastructure
11. **Graphic Gameplan** - Create whole-systems action plan
12. **Graphic Roadmap** - Document milestones and commitments

## Integration with b9/p9/j9 Architecture

### Telemetry Mapping

| Layer | Component | Metrics | Guides |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **b9** | Connection Edges | Localhost terminal patterns | Context Map, Stakeholder Map |
| **p9** | Execution Membranes | Globalhost thread pools | Graphic Gameplan, Graphic Roadmap |
| **j9** | Distribution Gradients | Orgalhost topology | Investment Portfolio, Value Proposition |

### AUTOGNOSIS Levels

| Level | Focus | T-System | Output |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Emission | T1, T8 | Raw telemetry signals |
| 1 | Patterns | T2, T7 | Recognized patterns |
| 2 | Self-Image | T3, T6 | System self-model |
| 3 | Optimization | T4, T5, T9 | Improvement recommendations |

## Team Performance (Drexler/Sibbet Model)

### Seven Stages

1. **Orientation** - Why am I here?
2. **Trust Building** - Who are you?
3. **Goal Clarification** - What are we doing?
4. **Commitment** - How will we do it?
5. **Implementation** - Who does what, when, where?
6. **High Performance** - Wow!
7. **Renewal** - Why continue?

### Assessment Dimensions
- **Resolved**: Stage successfully completed
- **Unresolved**: Stage needs attention
- **Current Focus**: Active development area
