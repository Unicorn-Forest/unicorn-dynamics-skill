# Unicorn Dynamics

Strategic visual planning and operational intelligence framework integrating Grove Consulting methodologies, Christopher Alexander's differentiation processes, and self-ontogenetic cognitive architectures.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Knowledge Sharing Mechanism (KSM)

The KSM combines Alexander's differentiation process with nested iteration cycles for problem-solving through centre strengthening.

**Alexander's Original 11-Step Differentiation Process:**

1. At any given moment in a process, we have a certain partially evolved state of a structure. This state is described by the **wholeness**: the system of centres, and their relative nesting and degrees of life.

2. We pay attention as profoundly as possible to this wholeness—its global, large-scale order, both actual and latent.

3. We try to identify the sense in which this structure is **weakest as a whole**, weakest in its coherence as a whole, most deeply lacking in feeling.

4. We look for the **latent centres** in the whole. These are not those centres which are robust and exist strongly already; rather, they are centres which are dimly present in a weak form, but which seem to us to contribute to or cause the absence of life in the whole.

5. We then **choose one of these latent centres** to work on. It may be a large centre, or middle sized, or small.

6. We use one or more of the **fifteen structure-preserving transformations**, singly or in combination, to differentiate and strengthen the structure in its wholeness.

7. As a result of the differentiation which occurs, **new centres are born**. The extent of the fifteen properties which accompany creation of new centres will also take place.

8. In particular we shall have **increased the strength** of certain larger centres; we shall also have increased the strength of parallel centres; and we shall also have increased the strength of smaller centres. As a whole, the structure will now, as a result of this differentiation, be stronger and have more coherence and definition as a living structure.

9. We **test to make sure** that this is actually so, and that the presumed increase of life has actually taken place.

10. We also test that what we have done is the **simplest differentiation possible**, to accomplish this goal in respect of the centre that is under development.

11. When complete, we **go back to the beginning** of the cycle, and apply the same process over.

**KSM 12-Step Dual Perspective:**

| Step | Perspective A (Analysis) | Perspective B (Transformation) |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | Analyze Problem in Space and Time | Desired End-State |
| 2 | Differentiate Tasks into Centres | Transform Tasks to Centers |
| 3 | Choose Critical Centre | Choose Critical Center |
| 4 | Identify Constraints and Relationships | Desired End-State (Iteration) |
| 5 | Differentiate Sub-Tasks to Centres | Transform Tasks to Centers |
| 6 | Strengthen Centres | Strengthen Centers |
| 7 | Integrate with Iteration Vision | Compare to Iteration Vision |
| 8 | Evaluate Correctness and Simplicity | Simplify the Centers; Assess Iteration Vision |
| 9 | Assess Iteration Vision | Feedback |
| 10 | Integrate with Solution Vision | Compare to Solution Vision |
| 11 | Evaluate Correctness and Simplicity | Simplify the Center; Assess Solution Vision |
| 12 | Assess Solution Vision | Feedback |

**Outer Loop (Solution Cycle - Steps 1-3, 10-12):**

| Step | Action | From | To |
| 1 | **Desired End-State** | Problem | Solution Vision |
| 2 | **Transform Tasks to Centers** | Solution Vision | Centers |
| 3 | **Choose Critical Center** | Centers | → Inner Loop |
| 10 | **Compare to Solution Vision** | Assess | Solution Vision |
| 11 | **Simplify the Center; Assess Solution Vision** | Solution Vision | Assess |
| 12 | **Feedback** | Assess | Problem |

**Inner Loop (Iteration Cycle - Steps 4-9):**

| Step | Action | From | To |
|------|--------|------|----|
| 4 | **Desired End-State** | Strengthen Center (Iteration) | Iteration Vision |
| 5 | **Transform Tasks to Centers** | Iteration Vision | Centers |
| 6 | **Strengthen Centers** | Centers | Strengthened Centers |
| 7 | **Compare to Iteration Vision** | Strengthened Centers | Assess |
| 8 | **Simplify the Centers; Assess Iteration Vision** | Assess | Iteration Vision |
| 9 | **Feedback** | Iteration Vision | Strengthen Center (Iteration) |

**Key Entities:**
- **Problem**: Initial state requiring transformation
- **Solution Vision**: Global desired end-state for entire problem
- **Iteration Vision**: Local desired end-state for current iteration
- **Centers**: Transformed task/sub-task units
- **Strengthened Centers**: Successfully transformed centers
- **Strengthen Center (Iteration)**: Output of inner loop, input to outer loop
- **Assess**: Comparison/evaluation checkpoints

**Process Dynamics (Both Perspectives):**

| Phase | Perspective A | Perspective B | Steps |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Vision Setting | Analyze/Identify | Desired End-State | 1, 4 |
| Differentiation | Differentiate Tasks | Transform Tasks to Centers | 2, 5 |
| Transformation | Strengthen Centres | Strengthen Centers | 6 |
| Alignment | Integrate with Vision | Compare to Vision | 7, 10 |
| Evaluation | Evaluate Correctness & Simplicity | Simplify and Assess | 8, 11 |
| Completion | Assess Vision | Feedback | 9, 12 |

**Four Conditions for Differentiation:**
- Awareness of the Whole
- Step-by-Step Adaptation
- Unpredictability
- Feedback

### 2. KIM Roles (PDCA Mapping)

| Role | PDCA | Function | Mode |
|------|------|----------|------|
| **Framer** | Plan | Design architecture, see problem as whole | Topsight |
| **Maker** | Do | Create innovative solutions (Hoshin) | Insight |
| **Finder** | Act | Find resources, refine products (Kaizen) | Insight |
| **Sharer** | Check | Provide feedback, disseminate knowledge | Topsight |

### 3. T-System (9 Transformations)

Map cognitive/operational phases to four centres (C1-Idea, C2-Knowledge, C3-Routine, C4-Form):

| T-Code | Name | Description | Triad | Mode |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|------|
| T1 | Perception | Pairs coalesce, need relates to capacity | Form | Sensory |
| T4 | Mental Work | Sensory/proprioceptive alternation | Form | Structure |
| T7 | Memory Resources | Routine+Form quantized as technique | Form | Structure |
| T2 | Creation | Form fed back through routine to idea | Void | Motor |
| T5 | Physical Work | Idea→Knowledge→Routine with feedback | Void | Process |
| T8 | Creative Feedback | Countercurrent balances form with idea | Void | Motor |
| T3 | Transference | Idea transferred to form via knowledge+routine | Pole | Relational |
| T6 | Corporeal Body | Mutual identities within common form | Pole | Association |
| T9 | Renewed Perception | Discretionary hierarchy: C1→C2→C3→C4 | Pole | Relational |

### 4. Triadic Architecture Mapping

The T-System organizes into three triads that map directly to the b9/p9/j9 architecture:

| Triad | T-Codes | Mode | Architecture | Component |
|-------|---------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Form** | T7, T4, T1 | Structure / Sensory | b9 | Rooted trees (localhost terminal) |
| **Void** | T2, T5, T8 | Process / Motor | p9 | Membrane pools (globalhost threads) |
| **Pole** | T3, T6, T9 | Association / Relational | j9 | Resonant echoes (ESN reservoir) |

This triadic structure reflects the Agent-Arena-Relation (AAR) core:
- **b9 (Form/Structure)**: The arena as rooted tree topology
- **p9 (Void/Process)**: The agent as membrane execution dynamics
- **j9 (Pole/Association)**: The relation as echo state network resonance

### Phase 2: Future Planning
5. **Cover Story Vision** - Create intuitive future-state story
6. **Mandala Vision** - Cluster themes into unified whole
7. **Journey Vision** - Map past→present→future trajectory
8. **Stakeholder Map** - Identify key relationships

### Phase 3: Action Planning
9. **Five Bold Steps** - Define specific strategic initiatives
10. **Value Proposition** - Clarify offer, connection, infrastructure
11. **Graphic Gameplan** - Create whole-systems action plan
12. **Graphic Roadmap** - Document milestones and commitments

## Team Performance (Drexler/Sibbet Model)

### Seven Stages

1. **Orientation** - Why am I here?
2. **Trust Building** - Who are you?
3. **Goal Clarification** - What are we doing?
4. **Commitment** - How will we do it?
5. **Implementation** - Who does what, when, where?
6. **High Performance** - Wow!
7. **Renewal** - Why continue?

### Assessment Dimensions
- **Resolved**: Stage successfully completed
- **Unresolved**: Stage needs attention
- **Current Focus**: Active development area
