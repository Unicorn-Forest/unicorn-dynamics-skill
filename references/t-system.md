# T-System Reference

Detailed documentation of the 9 cognitive transformations and their integration with the four centres.

## The Four Centres

The T-System operates on four fundamental centres that represent different aspects of cognition and action:

| Centre | Name | Function | Metaphor |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| **C1** | Idea | Direction, potential action, creative concept | The spark |
| **C2** | Knowledge | Ordered information, resource capacity | The library |
| **C3** | Routine | Action sequences, muscular activity | The practice |
| **C4** | Form | Physical output, motor response | The artifact |

### Centre Relationships

```
C1 (Idea) ──────▶ C2 (Knowledge) ──────▶ C3 (Routine) ──────▶ C4 (Form)
    ▲                                                              │
    └──────────────────── Feedback ────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Nine Transformations

### T1: Perception of the Field (M/Performance)

**Description:** The separate centres coalesce in pairs: C1 with C2, and C3 with C4. Perceived need relates to resource capacity to respond.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
(C1 ⟷ C2)    (C3 ⟷ C4)
  Idea+         Routine+
  Knowledge     Form
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Department: Marketing
- Function: Perception of need in relation to response capacity
- PDCA: Plan (initial)

**Application:**
- Environmental scanning
- Needs assessment
- Resource inventory
- Gap analysis

---

### T2: Creation of Idea (G/Potential)

**Description:** C1, C2, and C3 form double identities as a known potential to enact idea in routine. Form C4 is fed back from the environment through routine C3 to find identity as a superimposed idea.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  C1 ⟷ C2 ⟷ C3  │
    └────────┬────────┘
             │
             ▼
            C4 (feedback)
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Department: Development
- Function: Creation of idea as potential action response
- PDCA: Plan (creative)

**Application:**
- Ideation sessions
- Concept development
- Innovation workshops
- Design thinking

---

### T3: Transference of Idea (G/Universal)

**Description:** C2 and C3 are coalesced. Knowledge contains idea. Routine contains form. Idea is thus transferred to form through the coalescence of knowledge and routine.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
C1 ──▶ [C2 ⟷ C3] ──▶ C4
        Knowledge+
        Routine
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Function: Transference of idea to form
- Mode: Universal/Secondary
- PDCA: Plan→Do transition

**Application:**
- Knowledge transfer
- Training programs
- Documentation
- Standard operating procedures

---

### T4: Mental Work (C/Commitment)

**Description:** C1 and C2 coalesce within C3 separate from C4. Idea and knowledge together relate through routine with external form. Alternating countercurrent identities with either idea or knowledge are superimposed.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  [C1 ⟷ C2]     │
│      ↓         │
│     C3         │
└────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
       C4 (external)
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Department: Organization
- Function: Ordered sensory input alternately from environment or simulated
- PDCA: Check (mental)

**Application:**
- Analysis and planning
- Decision-making
- Simulation and modeling
- Strategic thinking

---

### T5: Physical Work (C/Commitment)

**Description:** Idea C1 directs knowledge C2 from within, which in turn directs routine C3, which finds physical identity in form C4. A countercurrent proprioception feeds back from form via C3 and C2 to idea.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
C1 ──▶ C2 ──▶ C3 ──▶ C4
 ▲                    │
 └────── feedback ────┘
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Department: Production
- Function: Action sequence of muscular activity with proprioceptive feedback
- PDCA: Do (execution)

**Application:**
- Implementation
- Production processes
- Service delivery
- Operational execution

---

### T6: Corporeal Body (C/Universal)

**Description:** Idea C1, knowledge C2, and routine C3 find mutual double identities within the context of common form C4. Each triad member also projects independently through form, lending it specific bounds.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
        C4 (Form)
       /   |   \
      /    |    \
    C1    C2    C3
    (mutual identities)
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Function: Corporeal integration
- Mode: Universal/Secondary
- PDCA: Do (embodiment)

**Application:**
- System integration
- Organizational alignment
- Culture embodiment
- Brand manifestation

---

### T7: Memory Resources (G/Potential)

**Description:** Routine C3 is coalesced with form C4 as a quantized element of technique within knowledge C2 and idea C1. T7 eternally reconciles inside and outside as a timeless element of memory.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
C1 ──▶ C2 ──▶ [C3 ⟷ C4]
              Technique
              (quantized)
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Department: Finance
- Function: Sequence encoded as unit memory for recall
- PDCA: Act (memory)

**Application:**
- Knowledge management
- Best practices capture
- Lessons learned
- Institutional memory

---

### T8: Creative Feedback (M/Performance)

**Description:** Countercurrent identities balance form C4 with idea C1 through routine C3, all within the context of knowledge C2. An output responds to balance input, and vice versa, along with resource renewal.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
        C2 (Knowledge context)
       ┌────────────────────┐
       │  C4 ⟷ C3 ⟷ C1    │
       │  Form   Routine  Idea│
       └────────────────────┘
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Department: Sales
- Function: Balanced response to sensory stimuli as motor output
- PDCA: Act (feedback)

**Application:**
- Performance feedback
- Customer response
- Adaptive systems
- Continuous improvement

---

### T9: Renewed Perception (M/Universal)

**Description:** Idea C1 gives direction to knowledge C2 which gives direction to routine C3 which gives direction to form C4. This is the universal discretionary hierarchy of System 4.

**Centre Configuration:**
```
C1 ──▶ C2 ──▶ C3 ──▶ C4
(Discretionary Hierarchy)
```

**Operational Mapping:**
- Function: Renewed perception of the field
- Mode: Universal/Primary
- PDCA: Plan (renewal)

**Application:**
- Strategic renewal
- Vision refresh
- Cycle completion
- New initiative launch
